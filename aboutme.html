                <h2> About Me </h2>
                <p> My name is Dominique, I was born in west oakland,. 
                There is a funny story behind this, I was born at home, 
                its funny because my mom didnt know she was in labor 
                she just thought she had food poisoning because the 
                day before she ate some fast food.</p>
                <p>Anyways I am mixed I am Puerto Rican, and Black. My 
                grandparents originated from Ponce and Adjuntas Puerto Rico.</p>
                <p> I have a very big family and growing up with a lot of 
                older and younger cousins was kinda hard, because there were
                only 2 other cousins that were my age so when we would
                hang out it wasnt just the 3 of us it was everyone and we 
                couldnt keep things to ourselves so we all knew eachothers
                secrets for the most part.</p>
                <p> During holidays or special accation we would go the house of a 
                family member that had the biggest house and we would always have a 
                good time, until someone gets drunk and starts to pick a verbal
                fight.</p>
                <p> To be honest there has never been a year where there hasnt
                been a verbal altercation, but at this point everyone is used
                to it.</p>
                <p>In my family everyone plays a different sport, but i
                love to play soccer and volleyball. I enjoy playing other sports 
                but those are my 2 favorite sports. Volleyball season has 
                recently passed which I didnt tryout for, because my mom
                couldn work it around her schedual. But there will soon be 
                tryouts for the soccer team, which Im excited for but Im also
                really nervous that I wont make the team. Im a pretty good
                student, well from what I was from previous years. I currently 
                have a 3.82 GPA. </p>
